            <h3 class="paragraph-friends">Can you make Friends in an Arcade?</h3>
            <p class="paragraph-friends-body">That is a great question. Friendship, something we all desire. 
                We can find friends anywhere, but if you are a big fan of video games arcades are the place to be. 
                You can meet many people who's love of video games match yours.</p>
            <p class="paragraph-friends-body">The environment inside an Arcade is a very different one than lets say the mall.
                Making friends might seem impossible at first. But just remeber, everyone there is looking for a good time. Don't
                be afraid to ask someone if you can play with them. This is the number one rule to finding friends at the arcade. 
                Everyone is there to have fun. So have fun playing with everyone!
            </p>
            <h5 class="paragraph-friends">Fun for Everyone?</h5>
            <p class="paragraph-friends-body">Some people may not like video games. Thats ok, arcades normally have stuff for everyone to 
                enjoy. Like a bucket to shoot some hoops, a pizza dinner, and other activities that are for those of us who really don't like flashing pixels. 
                This is why an Arcade is an amazing date night option. If you and someone you really care about have no ideas on what to 
                do that night. Why? You both don't need to be good at video games to enjoy them. 
                Some of the greatest memories us at Croco's Arcade have been when we play an arcade game with our friends 
                and family. That we all would be terrible at it. It was not in the fact we were all good that made it fun, 
                it was the fact that we were enjoying our friendship together.
