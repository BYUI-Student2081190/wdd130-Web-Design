            <p class="ideas-paragraphs">Here at Croco's Arcade, we give you a virtual memory arcade through our community
                based website. Our goal at Croco is to make the 80's and 90's hype for Arcades become a thing later generations
                can enjoy as well.
            </p>
            <h5 class="ideas">Why we do What We Do</h5>
            <p class="ideas-paragraphs">As times keep changing things that are the thing start to fade out of style.
                Here in the U.S. Arcades are slowly starting to fizzle out, because of at home systems, and are now
                becoming more of a place for people to just win tickets and get a prize. Rather than have fun actually
                playing a video game that can only be played in an arcade.
            </p>
            <p class="ideas-paragraphs">Here at Croco, we are all very much arcade fans. Arcades have played a very special
                role in our lives. Our goal is to give some of that love we have for arcades back to them. Our site is divided into 
                three sections. Our goals on the home page, an article we hand wrote on how Arcades influence friendships on the 
                friendships tab, and finally a few helps on how to search for a local arcade near you on the Near Me tab.
