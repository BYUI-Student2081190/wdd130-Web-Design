      </h2>
      <h3>Home page</h3>
      <p>
        The home page's purpose will be to introduce the views to “Croco's Arcade, a webpage dedicated to refreshing your “Retro-Memories””
        It will talk about the purpose behind what we do a little bit. We are dedicated to bringing back the glory of arcades here in the U.S.
        Bringing up as much good as we can about arcades is priority. Also giving people an opportunity to look for local arcades around them
        and help boost the money income for those small and ancient arcades. If we can help people recognize that arcades are a dying breed of
        entertainment, and that we can stop them from dying off, we will be able to save them. And also allowing people to recognize that the
        glory days of arcades can still be going on today with the modern generation.

      </ul>
      <h3>Friendships</h3>
      <p>
        Friendship, something we all desire. We can find friends anywhere,
        but if you are a big fan of video games arcades are the place to be.
        You can meet many people who's love of video games match yours.
        We will also talk about the kind of environment you have when at an arcade. 
        In normal arcades you normally hang out with a group, but you can easily find 
        a few people to hang out with at any given moment. If you are ever struggling with a date idea for someone you care about, 
        an arcade is a very good option, you both don't need to be good at video games to enjoy them.
        Some of the greatest memories us at Croco's Arcade have been when we would all play the same game with our friends and all
        of us would be terrible at it. It was not in the fact we were all good that made it fun, it was the
        fact that we were enjoying our friendship together. It's a lot more fun to share something together, helping your
        children play a game for the first time is a time of a life time. Allowing an arcade be your child's first gaming
        outlet will be a treasure to both you and your child.

        On this page of the website, we really want to focus on how arcades can bring people together,
        and encourages people to post their favorite arcade memories with the #RetroMems on their social media platform. 
        This will cause many people to become friends through the memories they have of arcades,
        and also allow them to have more motivation to go and help support their local arcades. 
        Having links to popular social media sites would be awesome for this because they can just click the link
        right after reading something inspirational.

      <h3>Near Me</h3>
      <p>
        Near me, it is always good to know where something you want to support is.
        Luckily unlike a donation, you get to play a lot of video games when you go to an arcade.
        On this page we would like to provide a link to google maps, and encourage the viewer to click this link and type in “arcades near me”.
        Google maps will then pull up some local arcades for the viewer in their area.
         
        Another thing this page will do is talk about some local arcade to the area the website was made in.
        It was made in Utah, so we will provide some links “Nickle-Mania” and “Nickle-Cade” as a few of the arcades.
        Our big goal is to try to help smaller traditional arcades, instead of big entertainment centers that just have ticket games, 
        like Boondocks for example. Those places are good and still host arcades, but they focus more on the money they can get from you,
        than actually about the games they have in their arcade.

      <h3>Home</h3>
      <p>         
        One thing to notice is that the way the text is planned to be formatted will go across all the pages. The headers will 
        have the Press Start P2 font and the body of the paragraphs will have the PT Sans.

      <h3>Near Me [Page 3]</h3>
      <p>         
        This page might include a few links to local arcades to people who live in Salt Lake City. It will
        also provide a link to google maps so people can search for their own arcades near them around the U.S.
