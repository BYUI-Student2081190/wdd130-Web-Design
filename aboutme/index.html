        <h2>Christopher Scott</h2>
        <p> Hey! This is Christopher, I am from West Jordan Utah in the United States. Here is a little information on well... me.
            I have been a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints for my whole life. Born and raised in it and
            still loving it today. I served a mission in the Montana Billings Mission, which was a lot of fun, though I did not leave
            my home country. 
        </p>
        <p>I am not married and I am presuing my education to get a job to help support a future family. I feel like web development is
            super important because that is where the world is heading, into the digital world. This will help me when I go to get a job,
            I will have so much different coding skills under my belt, that they will have to accept me right? Haha!
        </p>
        <p>
            In my spare time I like to draw comics, and anything else I feel like drawing. I also love videogames, they are the reason I wanted
            to learn to code. As a kid I always tried my best to break or figure out how my game I was playing worked. I loved old games, even as
            old as Pong and other games of that same generation. This has been a little about me. It is super awesome to get to know all of you! 
            Have an awesome day today!
